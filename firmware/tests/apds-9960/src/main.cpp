Tests the gesture sensing abilities of the APDS-9960. Configures
APDS-9960 over I2C and waits for gesture events. Calculates the
direction of the swipe (up, down, left, right) and displays it
on a serial console. 

To perform a NEAR gesture, hold your hand
far above the sensor and move it close to the sensor (within 2
inches). Hold your hand there for at least 1 second and move it
away.

To perform a FAR gesture, hold your hand within 2 inches of the
sensor for at least 1 second and then move it above (out of
range) of the sensor.

Hardware Connections:

IMPORTANT: The APDS-9960 can only accept 3.3V!

  This is a library for the APDS9960 digital proximity, ambient light, RGB, and gesture sensor

  This sketch puts the sensor in gesture mode and decodes gestures.
  To use this, first put your hand close to the sensor to enable gesture mode.
  Then move your hand about 6" from the sensor in the up -> down, down -> up, 
  left -> right, or right -> left direction.

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit APDS9960 breakout
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/3595

  These sensors use I2C to communicate. The device's I2C address is 0x39
